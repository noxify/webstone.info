## Introduction

This is a simple plugin, which is based on a discord discussion.
It's more a workaround than a permanent solution.

The plugin should work with any data source, but I have tested it only with `source-filesystem`.

## Installation

```shell
npm install -s https://github.com/noxify/gridsome-plugin-remote-image.git

# or

yarn add https://github.com/noxify/gridsome-plugin-remote-image.git
```


## Usage

```js:title=gridsome.config.js
module.exports = {
  siteName: 'Gridsome',
  plugins: [
    //...
    
    //single image - cache:true - original: false
    {
      use: '@noxify/gridsome-plugin-remote-image',
      options: {
        'typeName' : 'Entry',
        'sourceField': 'remoteImage',
        'targetField': 'imageDownloaded',
        'targetPath': './src/assets/remoteImages'
      }
    },
    //multiple image - cache:true - original: false
    {
      use: '@noxify/gridsome-plugin-remote-image',
      options: {
        'typeName' : 'Entry',
        'sourceField': 'remoteImages',
        'targetField': 'imagesDownloaded',
        'targetPath': './src/assets/remoteImages'
      }
    },
    
    //single image - cache:true - original: true
    {
      use: '@noxify/gridsome-plugin-remote-image',
      options: {
        'original' : true,
        'typeName' : 'Entry',
        'sourceField': 'remoteImage',
        'targetField': 'imageDownloaded',
        'targetPath': './src/assets/remoteImages'
      }
    },
    //single image - cache:false - original: false
    {
      use: '@noxify/gridsome-plugin-remote-image',
      options: {
        'cache': false,
        'typeName' : 'Entry',
        'sourceField': 'remoteImage',
        'targetField': 'imageDownloaded',
        'targetPath': './src/assets/remoteImages'
      }
    }
  ]
  //...
}
```

## Supported field types

### string

```
---
title: Post title
remoteImage: https://example.com/image.jpg
---
```

### Array

```
---
title: Post title
remoteImages: 
  - https://example.com/image1.jpg
  - https://example.com/image2.jog
---
```

### Object

```
---
title: Post title
key1: 
  key2: https://example.com/image1.jpg
  key3: 
    - https://example.com/image1.jpg
    - https://example.com/image2.jog
---
```

## Limitations

### Target field name

Currently, it's not possible to define a nested field for the `targetField` definition.

### Fetch data from a reference

Currently you have to define the collection where the images are stored.

If you have a `Post` collection which has a reference to `Asset`, you can't use `Post` as `typeName` and `image.url` as `sourceField`.

You have to use `Asset` as `typeName` and `url` as `sourceField`.

### GraphQL Data Source

In case you're using graphql as data source, you're not able to use this plugin.

Since the graphql source plugin(s) doesn't copy the data into the local schema, the plugin has no access to this data.

* https://github.com/noxify/gridsome-plugin-remote-image/issues/22

### Not supported field type

Currently the plugin doesn't support `array of objects`.
